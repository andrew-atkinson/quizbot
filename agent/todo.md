## feature list dump

Somethings are just ideas and not necessarily to be implemented, this is just a holding place but can be referenced to move the project forward.

### List items

- the quiz instructions should say what videos the questions are from. Ideally it would provide a link to the video, so the student could review it. It also should introduce the quiz better.
  - **Investigated 2026-07-18 — the obvious approach won't work.** The `video_url` in the transcript
    front matter points at `aacontent.b-cdn.net`, the staging copy used to feed the transcriber. The
    Canvas course does not reference that domain at all: students watch videos embedded from
    **Panopto** (`montclair.hosted.panopto.com`). Linking the CDN URL would send students out of
    Canvas to a parallel copy.
  - **Per-video Panopto links aren't reliably recoverable.** The Panopto GUIDs live in the Canvas
    page embeds, but their titles are course-authored ("Rotations", "Shearing") while the transcripts
    use filename-derived ones ("2 for loops"). Some embeds have `title=""`. Any auto-matching would
    be fuzzy and would silently mislink. Fixing this properly belongs in the **videotranscriber** —
    it already reads a `canvas_manifest`, so that's where a Panopto URL could be captured at source.
  - **Viable alternative: link the quiz to its Canvas week page.** The pages are named predictably —
    `week-3-repetition.html`, `week-10-data-and-visualization.html` — and that slug is exactly what
    quizbot's existing `slugify(week_label)` already produces. Canvas rewrites the placeholder
    `$WIKI_REFERENCE$/pages/week-3-repetition` at import time, so no IDs, GUIDs or hardcoded domains
    are needed, and it degrades to plain text if the page is missing. One link per quiz rather than
    per question, but it lands the student on the page that holds the videos. Needs one Canvas test
    to confirm the placeholder resolves.
  - Splitting this into two items of very different cost:
    - **Name the source video per question** — doable now, `video_title` is in the front matter, no
      linking risk. The wrinkle: quizbot generates per _week_, not per video, so the model would need
      to attribute each concept to a video.
    - **Link the quiz to its Canvas week page** — the `$WIKI_REFERENCE$` approach above.
- could the videotranscriber be adapted to transcribe other teaching materials into a similar format for the chatbot, such as readings (PDFs), slide shows (without video), even external links to other online materials?
- added spaced learning into the quizzes? such as adding a question from a previous week.
  - Note: the bank format already supports this — `bank.json` is per-week, so a "revision" quiz could
    draw groups from several weeks' banks without regenerating anything. `qti.bundle()` already
    combines multiple banks into one package.
- parameterize quiz number of questions and randomize question bank. Different numbers of questions, whether or not there are variations and random. Also, different types of questions lead to different ideas about random/number: probably a faculty member is not going to want a randomised essay question for example.
- if the courseconfig.py needs a canvas manifest, what creates that manifest?
- in prompts/pages/system.md it is assuming that this is only for coding. We need a level of abstraction for different types of content. What if this was a photo or art course? This would be useless. It also seems that both the system and task files are project specific and so should live in the project folder, but should also be strucutred by generated out of the content.
- voice - the current voice is very dry and factual. and borrrrring.
- **Syntax highlighting for code blocks — and the deeper idea behind it** (user, 2026-07-20). The
  user's insight: code highlighting makes *semantic* distinctions (keyword / string / comment /
  number) through color, and that maps to *pedagogic* distinctions (concept / example / caveat).
  Two threads:
  1. **Highlight `code` blocks.** Tokenise with a lexer (Pygments) and emit **inline-styled**
     `<span>`s (Pygments' `noclasses=True` inline formatter → sanitizer-safe; no `<style>` block).
     The token→color map comes from the **theme's palette**, so each identity highlights in its own
     colors (terminal's segment hues are a natural token palette). Guardrail: the property-allowlist
     test already covers it, and the escaping round-trip must still hold through the added spans.
     Pygments would be a new dependency; confirm it's Canvas-safe first.
  2. **The mapping made explicit.** The `terminal` identity already does this at the page level —
     section `role` → segment-chip hue is exactly "token type → color". Worth naming as a design
     principle: color is reserved for *semantic/pedagogic signal*, never decoration (which is also
     taste-skill's anti-slop rule and CLT signaling). The role→color system and code→color system
     should share one palette per theme.

### Next Items

- **Non-video ingestion for the transcriber** (confirmed needed 2026-07-20): ARST215/ARFD106 (photo,
  digital literacy) have Canvas exports but no transcripts, so pages/quizzes can't generate for them
  yet. The transcriber needs to ingest readings/PDFs/slides into the same `week-N.md` shape (idea
  already parked above). This is videotranscriber-repo work; coursekit consumes the result unchanged.

- Module Placement
  - Deferred once already. Needs the full-course cartridge format, whose empty `assessment_qti.xml`
    stub is exactly what imported empty twice (see `docs/canvasQuizStructure.md` → "The trap").
    Expect several Canvas test rounds.

### Restructure: quizbot → coursekit (planned, not yet done)

**Why.** The repo name now fights the architecture. `coursekit/` — the shared spine — lives
_inside_ quizbot, which is backwards, and the README has to open its layout section by
explaining that "quizbot is a generator sitting on a shared spine." Generator #2 (a page
generator) has no sane home: it isn't quizbot, and its own repo would recreate the copy-paste
problem that produced `hardware.py` in the first place.

**Target shape — two projects, not one, not three.**

```
coursekit/                     ← what quizbot becomes
  coursekit/                     core: providers · prompts · courseconfig · hardware
  generate/quiz/                 bank.py tools.py context.py  (today's quizbot)
  generate/page/                 next generator
  emit/{qti,gift}/               qti.py gift.py
  discover.py  app.py            input resolution, CLI

videotranscriber/              ← stays its own project
  depends on coursekit for providers/prompts; keeps mlx-whisper to itself
```

Dependency flows one way: `videotranscriber → coursekit`. No cycle.

**Why not merge the transcriber.** It pulls `mlx-whisper` — heavy and Apple-Silicon-specific.
Quizbot's whole runtime is pydantic/dotenv/rich/openai + stdlib. Merging would force a video
stack on a colleague who only wants to generate pages from a syllabus, which is hostile to the
institutional direction. It's also 6,542 working lines doing a genuinely distinct job:
_media → text_, versus _text → artifacts_.

**Why not three repos** (core / ingest / generators): cross-repo version skew is real overhead
for a project with one maintainer. Split core out later only if the dependency shape bites.

**When — the trigger is generator #2, not a date.**

- Do it _before_ starting the page generator. At that point it's a `git mv` plus import fixes
  while there is still only one generator.
- Do _not_ do it mid-feature. The rename should be one clean isolated commit, not entangled
  with new work.
- Spine work (prompts, hardware) is identical either way, so it proceeds in place. ✅ `hardware`
  is done — it now lives in `coursekit/` and is reached via `Provider.check_fit()`. ✅ `prompts`
  is done — `coursekit/prompts.py` + `prompts/quiz/{system,task}.md`, overridable per course at
  `<course>/.vtconfig/prompts/quiz/*.md`. Verified byte-identical against the old inline strings.

✅ **Structural diagram done** — see `agent/architecture.md` (mermaid source, tracked). It turned up
two things: the per-course prompt override is **unreachable from the CLI** (`run_unit` never passes
`project_root`, though `Unit.course_root` holds it), and `config.yaml` — which already names prompts
per course — is read by nobody. Both argue `courseconfig` belongs _below_ `discover.py`.

### Housekeeping

- `docs/` is in `.gitignore`, so `docs/canvasQuizStructure.md` — the Canvas format reference, and the
  most expensive knowledge in this project — is **not in version control**. Nor are the Canvas sample
  exports that were the ground truth for it. Either un-ignore the markdown and samples, or move the
  reference next to `agent/GIFT_format_compact.md`, which is already tracked.
- `agent/agents.md` is a stale plan doc for the output-persistence feature that shipped long ago.
  Delete it or mark it historical.
