## Flow of work — where each idea acts (triaged 2026-07-27)

The raw ideas live in the dump below; this is the actionable read, filed by the pipeline phase each
touches (ingest → generate → emit → design → new generators → meta). Effort is rough: **S** ~hours ·
**M** ~a day or two · **L** its own increment. _New_ = added this session.

**Ingest** (documents → `week-N.md`)

- Structure-aware PPTX — title slide → page title, repeated theme label → section, caption/notes roles. **M.** Biggest text-side lever for art decks.
- Vision captioning of slide/PDF images (the works themselves, not just captions). **L.** The real unlock for image-led courses.
- OCR for scanned PDFs **M**; `.doc` legacy + table/layout fidelity **S–M**, low priority.

**Generate · quizzes**

- **Generalize beyond coding** — drop the hard-coded code-completion `c5`; let the domain profile steer question forms. **M.** Standing BLOCKER for non-coding quizzes → do first.
- Parameterize question/variant counts (`quiz.yaml` `questions`/`variants`). **M.**
- ✅ **v1 SHIPPED** — Question evaluator: `coursekit evaluate` cold-reads each question against the week's material and writes `quiz-review.md`; report-only, configurable critic model. Validate on `examples/synthetic-course` (planted flaws + answer key). **Follow-ups:** (a) once its judgment proves reliable, **wire it into `generate` by default** for quizzes AND pages (auto-run after generation, surface flags); (b) extend the critic to **pages** (a page-shaped critic prompt + a page evaluator); (c) opt-in **auto-regeneration** of flagged questions (increment 2).
- _New:_ code-completion code is unreadable (no linebreaks) — formatting bug in the question body. **S–M.**
- Name the source video per question (`video_title` is in the front matter) **S**; spaced-learning quiz drawing prior-week banks **M** (infra: `qti.bundle`).

**Generate · pages**

- Extract deck images for inclusion (`pptx image.blob`; copyright gate). **M.**
- Syntax highlighting for `code` blocks (Pygments inline, theme palette). **M.**
- Voice: less dry/factual — prompt work. **S–M.**

**Emit**

- _New:_ align `emit cc` page order with `emit course` (numeric week sort, not string `1,10,2`). **S.** — `emit course` already sorts numerically via `cartridge._week_sort`; `cc.py` still lexical.
- Link each quiz to its Canvas week page (`$WIKI_REFERENCE$/pages/<slug>`). **S–M**, needs one Canvas test.
- Discussions and assignments+rubrics as new `CartridgeSource`s (the `emit course` seam is ready; module placement is already handled). **M** each.
- Canvas API emitter — **L**, gated on a local Canvas; file emitters stay first-class.

**Design system**

- _Known:_ Terminal inline-code contrast fails WCAG — and add real visual/screenshot testing so this class of bug is caught. **M**, correctness + test infra.
- Terminal chevron line-wrap + mobile breakpoints across all four themes. **M.**
- Colour-scheme helper (main · secondary at 60% sat · contrast at +117° hue). **S.**

**New generators (course-level)**

- _New:_ calendar / pedagogic cadence — reasons over the whole course (`context.yaml` + all weeks), the first course-scope generator. **L.**
- Lecture notes · study guides · assignments · discussion prompts — each is the proven seam (IR + tools + emitter). **L** each.

**DX / meta**

- _New:_ pytest logs only dots — set `addopts = "-v"` (or per-test ids) so it says what it tests. **S**, trivial.
- Course structure isn't always `week-N` — read it from a Canvas `imscc`, or ask the user. **M**, cross-cuts ingest + discover.
- Repo rename quizbot → coursekit **M** (structural debt; the trigger — generator #2 — is long past); transcriber onto the spine, provider union **L**, cross-repo.

**Suggested first pass (quick, high-signal):** pytest `-v` (S) → `emit cc` ordering (S) → code-completion formatting (S–M) → then the quiz-generalization blocker (M).

## feature list dump

Somethings are just ideas and not necessarily to be implemented, this is just a holding place but can be referenced to move the project forward.

### List items

- .vtconfig is an obselete title, which should be rename when the videotranscriber is integrated. perhaps rename to .coursekit? does .vtconfig live inside that?
- in the code completion question - the code given in the question is very poorly formatted (mostly no linebreaks) and difficult to read.
- creating a calendar - sense of pedagogic cadence.
- Question evaluator: we need a llm loop in the question generation that checks the validity of the question from a pedagogic/meaning perspective, and maybe from a student perspective. This is an example of a question that was generated for week 3 of the ARGS260 course: "Why is manual repetition problematic when changing a parameter like the radius of a shape?" The "correct" answer is "Changing one parameter requires manual updates to all subsequent lines." However, the question is missing some very important context: 1, it makes no mention that there's a row of circles, at all, 2, it makes no mention that all the circles are needed to change size in the question; 3, changing one circle's size is only important if the others need to change size (an aesthetic decision). So, the question should have some preamble – something like "you're drawing a horizontal row of circles, and need to make them a little smaller... Why is manual repetition problematic when changing a parameter like the radius of a shape?" An additional, separate, loop needs to check the content of the question. What is needed to ensure a cold read by another pass. Is it a different model? Clearing the memory? A specific prompt?
- when the course export is imported, the pages are out of order because it is using string precedent ordering: e.g. 1, 10, 2, 3, 4. Can we look at a way of specifying page orders, and presumably ordering other content? PS - this might be fixed. It seems to work this time in the canvas.docker. What's going on?
- pytest only outputs a list of dots – not very communicative. It should at least log out what it is testing.
- one idea for a color scheme generator - main color, secondary (main color at 60% saturation) and contrast (main color but rotated 117º on the hue wheel).
- In Terminal the chevron sometimes leaks over to the next line breaking the visual idea. let's look at mobile break points for type and legibility, aesthetic and so on. Look at all the design languages.
- in Terminal the inline code quotes e.g. (`loadJson()`) display a very light text on a near white background. Complete Nonsense in terms of design and WCAG. As WCAG at least can be deterministic, is it possible to write a tool that can _really_ check this. Please we need a more robust round of visual checks and I think need to implement some front end screen grab testing. PS: when imported on the local canvas docker, the text is black in a white box. What's going on here?
- it seems that the programs are assuming that the weeks will be in a form of 'week-X', which is definitely not always going to be the case.
  - if working from a canvas export, we need a way to understand the course structure from the imscc.
  - if working from some content (video at the moment, but could be otehrwise), we need a way to either assess and store what the organization is, or ask the user to input the data.
  - if generating content largely anew, we need a way to create structures that would work across the various generators.
- the quiz instructions should say what videos the questions are from. Ideally it would provide a link to the video, so the student could review it. It also should introduce the quiz better.
  - **Investigated 2026-07-18 — the obvious approach won't work.** The `video_url` in the transcript
    front matter points at `aacontent.b-cdn.net`, the staging copy used to feed the transcriber. The
    Canvas course does not reference that domain at all: students watch videos embedded from
    **Panopto** (`montclair.hosted.panopto.com`). Linking the CDN URL would send students out of
    Canvas to a parallel copy.v
  - **Per-video Panopto links aren't reliably recoverable.** The Panopto GUIDs live in the Canvas
    page embeds, but their titles are course-authored ("Rotations", "Shearing") while the transcripts
    use filename-derived ones ("2 for loops"). Some embeds have `title=""`. Any auto-matching would
    be fuzzy and would silently mislink. Fixing this properly belongs in the **videotranscriber** —
    it already reads a `canvas_manifest`, so that's where a Panopto URL could be captured at source.
  - **Viable alternative: link the quiz to its Canvas week page.** The pages are named predictably —
    `week-3-repetition.html`, `week-10-data-and-visualization.html` — and that slug is exactly what
    quizbot's existing `slugify(week_label)` already produces. Canvas rewrites the placeholder
    `$WIKI_REFERENCE$/pages/week-3-repetition` at import time, so no IDs, GUIDs or hardcoded domains
    are needed, and it degrades to plain text if the page is missing. One link per quiz rather than
    per question, but it lands the student on the page that holds the videos. Needs one Canvas test
    to confirm the placeholder resolves.
  - Splitting this into two items of very different cost:
    - **Name the source video per question** — doable now, `video_title` is in the front matter, no
      linking risk. The wrinkle: quizbot generates per _week_, not per video, so the model would need
      to attribute each concept to a video.
    - **Link the quiz to its Canvas week page** — the `$WIKI_REFERENCE$` approach above.
- could the videotranscriber be adapted to transcribe other teaching materials into a similar format for the chatbot, such as readings (PDFs), slide shows (without video), even external links to other online materials?
- added spaced learning into the quizzes? such as adding a question from a previous week.
  - Note: the bank format already supports this — `bank.json` is per-week, so a "revision" quiz could
    draw groups from several weeks' banks without regenerating anything. `qti.bundle()` already
    combines multiple banks into one package.
- parameterize quiz number of questions and randomize question bank. Different numbers of questions, whether or not there are variations and random. Also, different types of questions lead to different ideas about random/number: probably a faculty member is not going to want a randomised essay question for example.
- if the courseconfig.py needs a canvas manifest, what creates that manifest?
- in prompts/pages/system.md it is assuming that this is only for coding. We need a level of abstraction for different types of content. What if this was a photo or art course? This would be useless. It also seems that both the system and task files are project specific and so should live in the project folder, but should also be strucutred by generated out of the content.
- voice - the current voice is very dry and factual. and borrrrring.
- **Syntax highlighting for code blocks — and the deeper idea behind it** (user, 2026-07-20). The
  user's insight: code highlighting makes _semantic_ distinctions (keyword / string / comment /
  number) through color, and that maps to _pedagogic_ distinctions (concept / example / caveat).
  Two threads:
  1. **Highlight `code` blocks.** Tokenise with a lexer (Pygments) and emit **inline-styled**
     `<span>`s (Pygments' `noclasses=True` inline formatter → sanitizer-safe; no `<style>` block).
     The token→color map comes from the **theme's palette**, so each identity highlights in its own
     colors (terminal's segment hues are a natural token palette). Guardrail: the property-allowlist
     test already covers it, and the escaping round-trip must still hold through the added spans.
     Pygments would be a new dependency; confirm it's Canvas-safe first.
  2. **The mapping made explicit.** The `terminal` identity already does this at the page level —
     section `role` → segment-chip hue is exactly "token type → color". Worth naming as a design
     principle: color is reserved for _semantic/pedagogic signal_, never decoration (which is also
     taste-skill's anti-slop rule and CLT signaling). The role→color system and code→color system
     should share one palette per theme.

### Generalize quiz generation beyond coding (2026-07-24 — BLOCKER for non-coding quizzes)

The quiz half of "generalize beyond coding" (the page half shipped: de-biased prompts + content-shape
domain profile). `prompts/quiz/task.md` is coding-shaped and hard-fails elsewhere: generating a quiz
for the photo course could not complete question 5, which is hard-wired to be a code-completion
question. This should land **before** the combined pages+quizzes cartridge (no point bundling quizzes
that can't generate for the course). Infrastructure is already flexible (bank variants aren't
hard-capped; the position rule is code, scoped to MC) — mostly a prompt + config change, mirroring the
page work.

1. **Question forms: generic default + domain-specific options.** Remove the hard-coded "c5 =
   code-completion" from `task.md`; make the default subject-neutral (N concept groups, type mix suited
   to each concept). The **domain profile** (already injected into the quiz prompt via
   `domain_preface`) carries the specifics — a coding `domain.md` asks for a code-completion question
   where code exists; a photo one steers to identify / compare / attribute / analyse. One mechanism,
   consistent with pages. See [[content-shape-domain-profile]] equivalent for pages.
2. **Number of questions + variations, parameterized.** `quiz.yaml` `questions: N` (default 5) and
   `variants: M` (default 4); generalize the correct-answer-position rule from the hard 4 to M. Two
   enhancements: (a) an _analysis-suggested_ question count — a pass over the week's material proposes
   how many concepts it can fairly assess; (b) variants driven by class size (more students → more
   variants to reduce overlap) or simply professor-set.

### Page design + summarisation (2026-07-24, from real art-course output — coursekit-test)

Surfaced running pages on real art decks (Still Lives wk6, History Landscape wk7). Confirmed against
the generated `page.json`.

1. ✅ **DONE (branch `design-review-glossary`).** Prior-week review needs a distinct graphic treatment (all 4 themes). The page already emits a
   `role=review` opener that recaps the previous week (confirmed: wk7 opened "Review: The Constructed
   Image" recapping wk6's still-life themes). A look-back should _read_ as a different topic — its own
   graphic quality (a "previously / recap" band), distinct from current-week content. Build on the
   existing heading `role` system in the renderer + each theme. NOTE: the recap is currently
   **emergent** (the model does it from the prompt's "recap earlier weeks" line), not a real
   cross-week mechanism — the generator never sees the prior week. A _reliable_ spaced-learning
   feature (deliberately feeding prior-week concepts into the next week's generation) is a separate,
   bigger item.
2. **Variable summary length / detail level.** Introduce a `detail` control with ~3 settings: (1) one
   paragraph of key concepts, (2) today's medium outline, (3) near-complete detail. A generation knob
   — `page.yaml` `detail: brief|medium|full` (or a CLI flag) selecting a different task instruction.
3. ✅ **DONE (branch `design-review-glossary`).** Key-terms / glossary needs clear demarcation (all 4 themes). Now a labelled "Key Terms" frame (accent label + per-theme glyph, `glossary_label` configurable); a standalone/week glossary is a framed box, a concept-specific one folds in as a subsection ("Concept · Key Terms"). The glossary rendered directly
   under the last concept heading ("Landscape and Violence") with no separation, so the terms
   (Picturesque, French Formal Garden, Ha-ha, Sublime, New Topographics) misread as part of that
   section. Give the glossary its own labeled frame ("Key Terms"), visually distinct, regardless of
   where the model places it. Design-system fix.
4. **Extract images for later inclusion.** `python-pptx` gives embedded images via `shape.image.blob`;
   because image + caption + theme share a slide, extract them together (the richer structure-aware
   variant). The renderer already has an instructor-figures path to wire into. **Copyright gate:**
   these are artworks — instructor's own deck = instructor-sourced (within the boundary), but
   auto-embedding into distributed Canvas pages is a deliberate decision. Extract-to-files is safe now;
   embedding is the later step. Ties to "structure-aware PPTX" and the "vision captioning" items above.

### Next Items

- ✅ **DONE (branch `page-detail-level`).** CLI restructured into subcommands (`ingest` / `generate` /
  `emit qti|html|cc`), reachable as the `coursekit` command; each phase's flags live on its own
  subcommand. Original note kept below for context.
- **CLI command list needs restructuring (2026-07-24, later — not now).** The `app.py` command table
  (README "Commands") has grown cumbersome and hard to distinguish — generation flags, re-emit
  utilities (`--to-qti`/`--to-html`/`--to-cc`), and ingest all sit in one flat list, several doing
  subtly different things. It needs a clearer structure — likely **subcommands** grouping by phase
  (e.g. `generate` / `emit` / `ingest`) rather than a flat flag soup — so the surface is legible.
  Scope: `app.py` arg parsing + the README table + `docs/`. Deferred.

- **Document ingest — known limitations / future iterations** (shipped 2026-07-24 as
  `coursekit/ingest/`; supports PDF · docx · odt · pptx incl. speaker notes · txt/md, offline,
  `--ingest [--raw]`). Deferred to later iterations, roughly in value order:
  - **Visual content is dropped.** Images, diagrams, charts, and photos in slides/PDFs are ignored —
    a real gap for image-led courses. A vision-description pass (local vision model, like the
    transcriber's `vt_describe`) would caption them into the week doc. This is the heavy/vision axis.
  - **OCR for scanned PDFs.** A scanned page (image of text) extracts empty. Needs an OCR step
    (offline: tesseract/`ocrmypdf`, an external binary — weigh against the pydantic+stdlib footprint).
  - **Direct Google Slides / Docs import** (parked here 2026-07-24, user's courses are Slides-based):
    export-to-file works today (Download → PDF/PPTX/DOCX → `--ingest`); _live_ import is the
    online/OAuth axis, a reversal of the offline-first decision — its own project with an auth +
    copyright surface.
  - **`.doc`** (legacy binary Word) — no clean pure-Python reader; convert to `.docx`/PDF.
  - **Layout/table fidelity.** Multi-column PDFs and tables extract as interleaved linear text; the
    shaping pass mitigates but does not reconstruct structure. Table-aware extraction is a maybe.
  - **PPTX depth.** Chart data, SmartArt, and embedded objects are not read (slide text + notes are).
  - **Structure-aware PPTX** (surfaced 2026-07-24 on real art decks, `coursekit-test/source/`). The
    extractor is flat; the decks carry structure it ignores: a TITLE-layout agenda slide, a small
    per-slide text box repeating the section theme (the grouping — there are no PowerPoint sections),
    a caption placeholder (artist/title/year), the image, and occasional notes. A structure-aware
    mode could use the title slide as the page title, the repeated theme label as a section heading,
    and role the shapes (caption vs section vs notes) → a real outline instead of a flat list with the
    theme word repeated 8×. Somewhat tailored to this author's convention, but consistent enough to
    detect. **Biggest gap for image-led courses:** text extraction yields captions + theme tags but
    not the works themselves — a vision-captioning pass (item above) is what actually makes an art
    course work.

- **Non-video ingestion for the transcriber** (confirmed needed 2026-07-20): ARST215/ARFD106 (photo,
  digital literacy) have Canvas exports but no transcripts. NOTE: coursekit's own `--ingest` now
  covers readings/PDFs/slides directly (2026-07-24), so this transcriber-side work is largely
  superseded for the document case; it remains relevant only if video-specific ingestion is wanted.

- Module Placement
  - Deferred once already. Needs the full-course cartridge format, whose empty `assessment_qti.xml`
    stub is exactly what imported empty twice (see `docs/canvasQuizStructure.md` → "The trap").
    Expect several Canvas test rounds.

### Restructure: quizbot → coursekit (planned, not yet done)

**Why.** The repo name now fights the architecture. `coursekit/` — the shared spine — lives
_inside_ quizbot, which is backwards, and the README has to open its layout section by
explaining that "quizbot is a generator sitting on a shared spine." Generator #2 (a page
generator) has no sane home: it isn't quizbot, and its own repo would recreate the copy-paste
problem that produced `hardware.py` in the first place.

**Target shape — two projects, not one, not three.**

```
coursekit/                     ← what quizbot becomes
  coursekit/                     core: providers · prompts · courseconfig · hardware
  generate/quiz/                 bank.py tools.py context.py  (today's quizbot)
  generate/page/                 next generator
  emit/{qti,gift}/               qti.py gift.py
  discover.py  app.py            input resolution, CLI

videotranscriber/              ← stays its own project
  depends on coursekit for providers/prompts; keeps mlx-whisper to itself
```

Dependency flows one way: `videotranscriber → coursekit`. No cycle.

**Why not merge the transcriber.** It pulls `mlx-whisper` — heavy and Apple-Silicon-specific.
Quizbot's whole runtime is pydantic/dotenv/rich/openai + stdlib. Merging would force a video
stack on a colleague who only wants to generate pages from a syllabus, which is hostile to the
institutional direction. It's also 6,542 working lines doing a genuinely distinct job:
_media → text_, versus _text → artifacts_.

**Why not three repos** (core / ingest / generators): cross-repo version skew is real overhead
for a project with one maintainer. Split core out later only if the dependency shape bites.

**When — the trigger is generator #2, not a date.**

- Do it _before_ starting the page generator. At that point it's a `git mv` plus import fixes
  while there is still only one generator.
- Do _not_ do it mid-feature. The rename should be one clean isolated commit, not entangled
  with new work.
- Spine work (prompts, hardware) is identical either way, so it proceeds in place. ✅ `hardware`
  is done — it now lives in `coursekit/` and is reached via `Provider.check_fit()`. ✅ `prompts`
  is done — `coursekit/prompts.py` + `prompts/quiz/{system,task}.md`, overridable per course at
  `<course>/.vtconfig/prompts/quiz/*.md`. Verified byte-identical against the old inline strings.

✅ **Structural diagram done** — see `agent/architecture.md` (mermaid source, tracked). It turned up
two things: the per-course prompt override is **unreachable from the CLI** (`run_unit` never passes
`project_root`, though `Unit.course_root` holds it), and `config.yaml` — which already names prompts
per course — is read by nobody. Both argue `courseconfig` belongs _below_ `discover.py`.

### Housekeeping

- `docs/` is in `.gitignore`, so `docs/canvasQuizStructure.md` — the Canvas format reference, and the
  most expensive knowledge in this project — is **not in version control**. Nor are the Canvas sample
  exports that were the ground truth for it. Either un-ignore the markdown and samples, or move the
  reference next to `agent/GIFT_format_compact.md`, which is already tracked.
- `agent/agents.md` is a stale plan doc for the output-persistence feature that shipped long ago.
  Delete it or mark it historical.
